                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>Tricking Royale first started in 2016 where we train the next generation of trickers. We are a group of trickers that are passionate in helping others achieve tricks that seem humanly impossible. We started off with no tricking experience, but when we learnt how to flip for the first time. The excitement was overwhelming that we also want others to experience the same thing! The sense of accomplishment and confidence. </p>

                    <p>"Tricking is the aesthetic blend of physical movements influenced by the expression of self and the collective group of individuals. Traditionally, it was built on frameworks of various movement practices and sports such as martial arts, gymnastics and dancing but now, it stands on its own as a recognised sport and physical art form." <b>- Tim Farley, Tricker</b></p>
